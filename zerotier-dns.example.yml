# Base domain.  Could be a top-level domain for internal use only (e.g., zt) or
# a domain name with one or more subdomains (e.g., internal.yourdomain.com).
# By default, map members to "<member name>.zt".

# ID of the ZeroTier network.  Only one of "network" and "networks" can be
# specified.  E.g., if there is a network with ID "123abc" then this would map
# its members to "<member name>.zt":
#   network: "123abc"
network:

# Mappings between subdomains and ZeroTier network IDs.  Only one of "network"
# and "networks" can be specified.
networks:
  # E.g., if origin="zt" and there is a network with ID "123abc" then this would
  # map its members to "<member name>.home.zt":
  #   home: "123abc"

# Mappings between round-robin names and regexps to match members.  Names are
# matched within each network (i.e., if there are members matching a mapping in
# multiple networks then the name will be defined separately in each).
round-robin:
  # E.g., if the "home" network defined above had members "k8s-node-23refw" and
  # "k8s-node-09sf8g" this would create a name "k8s-nodes.home.zt" returning one
  # of them at random:
  #   k8s-nodes: "k8s-node-\w"
